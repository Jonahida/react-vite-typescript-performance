# React

This application was built using React v18.3.1.

After setting up the initial project, the files App.js and App.css were customized. Additionally, to simulate API requests, a "blog.json" file was created within the "src/" folder (as React doesn't allow reading files outside the project root).

The component src/components/Blog.js was developed to showcase information such as title, author, cover, and id, which was later integrated into App.js.

This setup establishes a foundational structure for constructing a React application.
